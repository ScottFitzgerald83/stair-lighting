## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Guidelines

Working with electricity and home modifications requires careful attention to safety:

### Electrical Safety
- **NEVER** work on powered circuits - always disconnect power before making changes
- Use a multimeter to verify power is off before touching connections
- Keep all connections insulated and away from metal or conductive surfaces
- Install proper wire strain relief at all connection points
- Use appropriate gauge wires for power connections (18 AWG minimum for main power)

### Installation Safety
- Wear eye protection when drilling or cutting materials
- Use appropriate PPE (gloves, masks) when working with adhesives or solvents
- Secure all wiring to prevent trip hazards
- Label all wires and connections for future maintenance
- Keep a fire extinguisher nearby during initial testing phases

### Operation Safety
- Install an emergency shutoff switch in an accessible location
- Test motion sensors thoroughly to ensure proper operation on stairs
- Ensure the system gracefully handles power outages (doesn't suddenly go dark)
- Verify the manual override switch is easily accessible
- Keep documentation accessible for future homeowners or maintenance personnel

## üì∏ Visual Documentation

All architectural and electronic illustrations follow the [Pencil Sketch Design Standard (Appendix G)] included in the Installer's Guide. These technical drawings provide visual guidance for each step of the installation process.

### üî≤ System Overview Block Diagram

This diagram illustrates the complete system architecture and testing setup using a breadboard, showing how the Raspberry Pi connects to the sensors, LED strips, and power supply. Note the central placement of the Pi as the control hub, with clear pathways for data and power connections.

<img src="assets/2.1_breadboard_setup.png" alt="System Block Diagram showing Raspberry Pi connections to sensors and LED strips on a breadboard" width="450"/>

**Key elements to observe:**
* Data flow from sensors to the Pi controller through GPIO pins. Ultrasonic sensor is connected to GPIO17 (trigger) and GPIO27 (echo).
* Power distribution architecture with separate paths for control logic and LED power to prevent voltage drops. Use 22AWG for the logic circuits and 18AWG for the LED strip power to minimize voltage loss.
* Signal pathway from controller to LED strips via level shifter. The level shifter ensures the 3.3V logic from the Pi is boosted to 5V for reliable LED communication.
* Logical separation of control and power components for reliability and safety. Mount the power supply in a separate enclosure to minimize interference.

When setting up the breadboard:
1. Place the Raspberry Pi centrally on the breadboard.
2. Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the designated GPIO pins, noting the orientation of the sensor.
3. Connect the LED strip's data input to the level shifter output.
4. Connect the 5V power supply to the LED strip and the Raspberry Pi (via the breadboard power rails).
5. Double-check all connections before applying power.
This testing setup confirms connectivity and functionality before permanent installation and allows for easy troubleshooting.

### üåÄ FSM Control Flow Diagram

The Finite State Machine (FSM) diagram displays the logical flow of the system's operation, detailing how it transitions between different states based on sensor inputs and timing. Understanding this flow is crucial for troubleshooting and customizing system behavior.

<img src="assets/2.2_pi_terminal_output.png" alt="FSM Flow diagram showing state transitions for motion detection" width="450"/>

**Key decision points in the diagram:**
* **Idle State**: The system rests in this state with lights off, awaiting sensor input. The `idle_timeout_sec` parameter controls how long the system stays in this state.
* **Transition Logic**: The system determines direction based on which sensor triggers first. If the bottom sensor triggers before the top, the state transitions to "ascending," and vice versa.
* **Timeout Logic**: After motion is no longer detected, a timer starts. Once it elapses (`fade_out_ms`), the lights smoothly fade to off.
* **Error Handling**: If a sensor fails to trigger within a specified time window, the system logs an error and returns to the idle state to prevent the lights from remaining on indefinitely.

**Example Scenarios:**

* **Walking Up**: The bottom sensor triggers first, causing the system to transition to the "ascending" state. The LEDs light up sequentially from bottom to top.
* **Walking Down**: The top sensor triggers first, initiating the "descending" state. The LEDs light up sequentially from top to bottom.
* **Passing By**: If both sensors trigger simultaneously or one sensor triggers and then quickly deactivates, the system assumes it's a false trigger and remains in the idle state.
* **Sensor Failure**: If one sensor fails to trigger for an extended duration, the system logs an error and resets to the idle state. This prevents the system from getting "stuck" in a lighting sequence.

This carefully designed FSM enables reliable and responsive control of the stair lighting system, creating a safe and magical user experience.

### üî¶ LED Channel Mounting Detail

This cross-sectional illustration shows the proper mounting technique for LED channels beneath stair treads. The invisible placement ensures the lighting effect is visible while the hardware remains concealed from view.

<img src="assets/3.1_led_channel_under_tread.png" alt="Cross-section diagram showing LED channel mounting under stair tread" width="450"/>

**Important installation details:**
* Correct positioning (15-20mm from edge) to maximize light diffusion
* Attachment methods for secure mounting to the underside of treads
* Clearance requirements (minimum 10mm) from the front edge
* Diffuser installation technique for even light distribution

---

### ‚ö° Power Injection Wiring Diagram

This wiring diagram demonstrates the power injection strategy required for longer LED runs. Power injection prevents voltage drop and ensures consistent brightness and color across all steps in the staircase.

<img src="assets/4.1_power_injection_map.png" alt="Detailed wiring diagram showing power injection points for LED strips" width="450"/>

**Key techniques illustrated:**
* Strategic injection points every 5 meters of LED strip
* Wire gauge requirements (18 AWG minimum) for main power lines
* Parallel power connection methodology to maintain voltage
* Ground wire continuity throughout the system for proper operation

---

### üè° Final Installation Rendering

This rendering shows the completed installation with the lighting effect in action. It provides a vision of the final aesthetic that combines functionality with the magical ambiance inspired by The Lord of the Rings.

<img src="assets/G_design_standard_reference.png" alt="Stylized rendering of completed stair lighting installation with warm glowing effect" width="450"/>

**Visual elements to note:**
* Natural cascading light effect on each step for elegant movement
* Warm color temperature (2700-3000K) reminiscent of Elven landscapes
* Concealed hardware for clean aesthetic and focus on the lighting effect
* Illumination pattern that guides movement naturally and safely

## üå°Ô∏è Environmental Considerations

Address these environmental factors for optimal performance and longevity:

### Temperature Management

| Component | Temperature Range | Symptoms if Exceeded | Solution |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Raspberry Pi | -10¬∞C to 85¬∞C operating | Throttling, instability, shutdown | Add ventilation to enclosure, heatsinks |
| LED Strips | -20¬∞C to 60¬∞C operating | Color shift, shortened lifespan | Ensure proper aluminum channel heat sinking |
| Power Supply | 0¬∞C to 40¬∞C recommended | Efficiency loss, potential failure | Mount in temperature-controlled space |
| Sensors | -10¬∞C to 70¬∞C operating | Erratic readings, false triggers | Shield from direct sunlight and heat sources |

### Humidity Considerations

1. **Indoor Environment** (30-60% RH): Standard IP65 rating sufficient
2. **Bathroom Adjacent** (60-80% RH): Use IP67 rating, sealed connections
3. **Outdoor Installation** (Variable RH): Fully sealed IP68 components required

Apply conformal coating to all exposed PCBs and use heat-shrink tubing for connections in high-humidity environments.

### Dust Management

## üèóÔ∏è Special Cases & Adaptations

Adapt this system to these special staircase scenarios:

### Split-Level Staircases

For staircases with landings or split levels:

1. **Sensor Placement** - Add middle sensors at landing areas
2. **Controller Logic** - Modify the FSM to handle intermediate states
3. **Power Planning** - Consider separate power supplies for each section
4. **Animation Adjustment** - Special configuration needed for continuous effects

See the supplementary guide `Split_Level_Adaptation.pdf` for detailed wiring diagrams.

### Curved Staircases

For spiral or curved stairs:

1. **LED Mounting** - Use flexible aluminum channels or custom-bent channels
2. **Strip Selection** - Higher density (60+ LEDs/m) recommended for smooth curves
3. **Power Injection** - Required more frequently due to complex wire routing
4. **Sensor Coverage** - Multiple sensors may be needed for complete coverage

Refer to `Curved_Stair_Modifications.pdf` for detailed mounting techniques.

### Outdoor Installations

For exterior staircases:

1. **Weather Protection** - IP68 components and waterproof enclosures required
2. **Temperature Rating** - Extended temperature components needed
